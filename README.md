# BLACK-FRIDAY-SALE USING PYTHON

#### PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the purchase amount that customers are likely to spend on Black Friday sales, based on various features such as gender, age, occupation, marital status, and product category. This project will use Python, a popular programming language for data analysis and machine learning.

#### DATASET:

The dataset for this project is publicly available on Kaggle and contains data on customer demographics, product categories, and purchase amounts for Black Friday sales. The dataset contains more than 500,000 rows and 12 columns.

#### PROJECT STRUCTURE:

Loading the dataset
Summary statistics
Preprocessing
Visualization
Feature engineering and manipulagtion
Split the data into train and test
Model building 

#### APPROACH:

The project will involve data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning using various Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoost. The data will be cleaned and transformed to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and consistent. The project will also include exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in the data.

The project will use various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, Random forest and XGBoost to predict the purchase amount that customers are likely to spend on Black Friday sales based on the available data. The performance of the machine learning models will be evaluated using  metrics  R-squared.

#### CONCLUSION:

The final output of the project will be a machine learning model that can predict the purchase amount that customers are likely to spend on Black Friday sales based on various features.  

The ML algorithm that perform the best was XGBoost Regressor Model.
