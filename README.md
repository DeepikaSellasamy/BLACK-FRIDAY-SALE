# BLACK-FRIDAY-SALE USING PYTHON

#### PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the purchase amount that customers are likely to spend on Black Friday sales, based on various features such as gender, age, occupation, marital status, and product category. This project will use Python, a popular programming language for data analysis and machine learning.

#### DATASET:

The dataset for this project is publicly available on Kaggle and contains data on customer demographics, product categories, and purchase amounts for Black Friday sales. The dataset contains more than 500,000 rows and 12 columns.

#### PROJECT STRUCTURE:

Loading the dataset
Summary statistics
Preprocessing
Visualization
Feature engineering and manipulation
Split the data into train and test
Model building 

#### APPROACH:

The project will involve data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning using various Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoost. The data will be cleaned and transformed to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and consistent. The project will also include exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in the data.

The project will use various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, Random forest and XGBoost to predict the purchase amount that customers are likely to spend on Black Friday sales based on the available data. The performance of the machine learning models will be evaluated using  metrics  R-squared.

#### INSIGHTS:

* 75% of the number of purchases are made by Male users and rest of the 25% is done by female users.

* Mean purchase rate between the age groups tends to be the same except that the 51-55 age group has a little higher average purchase amount.

* Age 26-35 Age group makes the most no of purchases in the age group.

* 60% of slaes comes from Unmarried people, the average purchase amount of married and unmarried people are the same.

* Products of category [5,1,8] are being purchased more.

* Products of category [10,7,6] are most expensive ones.


#### CONCLUSION:

An interesting observation can be made from the gender distribution plot that the number of females was less than the number of men who shopped during Black Friday.

The final output of the project will be a machine learning model that can predict the purchase amount that customers are likely to spend on Black Friday sales based on various features.  

The ML algorithm that perform the best was XGBoost Regressor Model.
